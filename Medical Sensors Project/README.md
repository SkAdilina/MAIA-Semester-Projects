# Project on Segmentation of the endocardial border of the left ventricle in diastole and systole

For our Medical Sensors course, we were asked to use the dataset from the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) MICCAI challenge 2017 and perform  Segmentation of the endocardial border of the left ventricle. We were also asked to choose a paper and re-implelement their entire work. We chose the paper by Amorim [1] for our project.

1. We downloaded the data from this link --> https://acdc.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/#challenge/5846c3366a3c7735e84b67ec and we implemented the python code (view_nifti.py) to extract the data from the nitfi format and write the images into a folder.
2. "FINAL-code-edge.py" contains the entire code to perform the segmentation.
