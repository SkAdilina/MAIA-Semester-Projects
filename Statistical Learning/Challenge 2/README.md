## Classification challenge on Alzheimer’s Disease

### The challenge consists in dealing with three binary classification problems using any of the studied approaches andmethods. 

### Your task is: 
- to choose the classifier that achieves the best performance classification results on the testdatasets.
- using three train datasets (ADCNtrain.csv, ADMCItrain.csv, MCICNtrain.csv) and three corresponding testdatasets (*test.csv). These include different numbers of observations and several independent variables. The first column (‘Subject_id’) indicates theID of each observation. The last column (‘Label’) is ‘AD’, ‘MCI’, or ‘CN’, depending on the training set.
- For each of the three binary problems, your submission will consist of two RData files containing the results and the selected features.
